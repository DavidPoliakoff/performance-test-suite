#
# The subdirectories in this directory contain different versions of the
# LULESH 1.0 proxy app. 
#
# The subdirectory LULESH-v1.0_baseline contains a reference version of 
# LULESH 1.0 that is available at https://codesign.llnl.gov/lulesh.php.
#
# The subdirectory LULESH-v1.0_RAJA-variants contains three RAJA variants
# of LULESH 1.0. They are in three files: 
#
# 1) luleshRAJA-serial.cxx contains a serial-only version.
# 2) luleshRAJA-parallel.cxx.src contains a version that can be run 
#    in 10 different parallel variants using RAJA (different data layouts,
#    different OpenMP parallelization strategies (including lock-free
#    dependency graphs), CilkPlus, and GPU using CUDA). See luleshPolicy.hxx
#    more more details and how to select the execution mode.
# 3) luleshRAJA-parallel-FT.cxx contains a version similar to #2, but with a
#    loop-level fault tolerance mechanism enabled. Also, all loops in the FT
#    version are idempotent which is required for the fault recovery mechanism
#    to relaunch loops. 
#
# When RAJA is compiled, the default variants of these examples will be 
# generated.
#
# RAJA must be built with CUDA enabled to generate GPU variants.
#
# NOTE: When running CUDA variants of RAJA LULESH, we advise you to set the
#       environment variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES to zero before running.
#       We are using CUDA Unified Memory and we find that this setting 
#       greatly improves performance.
