#
# The subdirectories in this directory contain different versions of the
# LULESH 2.0 proxy app. 
#
# The subdirectory LULESH-v2.0_baseline contains a reference version of 
# LULESH 2.0 that is available at https://codesign.llnl.gov/lulesh.php.
#
# The directory LULESH-v2.0_RAJA-variants contains three subdirectories with
# RAJA variants of LULESH 2.0. They are: 
#
# 1) LULESH-v2.0_RAJA-basic contains a basic translation to RAJA that uses
#    only RAJA forall traversals that take begin-end args or arrays of 
#    indirection indices. 
# 2) LULESH-v2.0_RAJA-IndexSet contains a version that uses RAJA IndexSets
#    similar to LULESH 1.0. It can be run in 3 different variants using RAJA.
#    See the file luleshPolicy.hxx for more details and how to select the 
#    execution mode.
# 3) LULESH-v2.0_RAJA-MICfriendly' contains a version that
#    uses RAJA IndexSets to permute data and loop iteration ordering in ways
#    that can be beneficial in a manycore environment.
#
# When RAJA is compiled, the default variants of these examples will be
# generated.
#
# RAJA must be built with CUDA enabled to generate GPU variants.
#
# NOTE: When running CUDA variants of RAJA LULESH, we advise you to set the
#       environment variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES to zero before running.
#       We are using CUDA Unified Memory and we find that this setting 
#       greatly improves performance.
